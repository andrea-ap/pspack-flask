pOOBs4 PS4 exploit for v9.0 + automatic gold hen
 
 ## About
 
This is just a repacked psOOBs4, as a flask package with the addition of automatic sending of GoldHEN. Some other small changes:

- Some magic numbers have been renamed (never looked at a PS4 bug before, and wanted to know wtf was going on)
- Some additional logging via HTTP requests (not massively useful as can't do a lot in critical section, but useful for kicking off goldenhen send)

All credit to the team behind pOOBs4

## Setup:

1. Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it, ideally 3.10
2. Install flask `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## Exploiting
1. Run app `python3 app.py`. Might need to run as root to bind to port 1337
2. Navigate to port 1337 on your host IP on your PS4
3. Same as psOOBs4
4. GoldHEN should be sent once the server detects success via log messages


## Help! It doesn't work on my machine

1. Try again
2. If you're not running 9.00, the exploit won't run. You'll need to modify [the template](https://github.com/mc-17/pspack-flask/blob/main/templates/index.html#L70) to match your version, or just remove the if/endif
